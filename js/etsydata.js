In a frame, the difference is hard to see, but please be aware that it is a high quality paper print.**\r\n\r\nThis is the quintessential gift for anyone who misses Chappelle&#39;s Show (and 2004) and wants to add a little fun to their home decor. \r\n\r\nEach print is from an original cross stitch, which has been lovingly designed and made by me. Stitching takes time and patience but you don&#39;t need either to enjoy this print!\r\n\r\nPrints are available in 8x10&quot; and 5x7&quot; sizes for easy framing. Pictures shown are 8x10&quot; version. Frame not included. Printed on heavyweight, ultra-smooth, matte finish Epson paper that&#39;s fade resistant for up to 70 years. Shipped flat.\r\n\r\nFeeling ambitious?

May have been played but handled with love and care (by DJs or vinyl enthusiasts). Might see some rough edges, scuffs here and there on the sleeve. Possible promotional cut-outs or cut corners.\r\n\r\nVery Good Plus(VG+): Mild scuffing and\/or visible surface scratches that might create some surface noise that is audible in between tracks and during quiet sections of songs. Probably has been played on more than a few occasions. The sleeve may show signs of wear and tear, bent corners, some fading of original color, ring wear, and\/or promotional cut-outs or cut corners.\r\n\r\nVery Good(VG): Visible signs of wear and tear caused by continuous playing. Scratches and scuffs may be much more visible causing surface noise to be more audible but still enjoyable to listen to. Possible writing may be visible on label and\/or sleeve. Edge-wear, scuffing , seam splits, ring wear, bent corners and\/or holes may be visible on the sleeve.\r\n\r\nGood(G): Record will definitely have visible scratches, scuffs, and\/or normal wear from being played frequently but should play through without skipping. Possible seam splits, ring wear, turned up corners, and\/ cut-out holes will be visible on the sleeve.

May have been played but handled with love and care (by DJs or vinyl enthusiasts). Might see some rough edges, scuffs here and there on the sleeve. Possible promotional cut-outs or cut corners.\n\nVery Good Plus(VG+): Mild scuffing and\/or visible surface scratches that might create some surface noise that is audible in between tracks and during quiet sections of songs. Probably has been played on more than a few occasions. The sleeve may show signs of wear and tear, bent corners, some fading of original color, ring wear, and\/or promotional cut-outs or cut corners.\n\nVery Good(VG): Visible signs of wear and tear caused by continuous playing. Scratches and scuffs may be much more visible causing surface noise to be more audible but still enjoyable to listen to. Possible writing may be visible on label and\/or sleeve. Edge-wear, scuffing , seam splits, ring wear, bent corners and\/or holes may be visible on the sleeve.\n\nGood(G): Record will definitely have visible scratches, scuffs, and\/or normal wear from being played frequently but should play through without skipping. Possible seam splits, ring wear, turned up corners, and\/ cut-out holes will be visible on the sleeve.
